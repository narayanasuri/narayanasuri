### Hi, I'm Suri :wave:

I'm a Web Developer / Experience Engineer based out of Chennai, TN. Java is my first language but I've been high on the JS ecosystem since forever :skull: I mostly work on React but I spend countless hours learning cool stuff and adapting to the latest tech out there.

While I'm not coding, you can find me raving about how beautiful :soccer: is. I'm a huge Chelsea fan and a sucker for cinema! I also play the guitar and sing.

Check out my recent project, Literature, a multiplayer card game - [LitAF](https://play-litaf.herokuapp.com)

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
