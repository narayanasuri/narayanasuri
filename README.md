    :wave: Hi, I'm Suri
    <br />
    I'm a Web Developer / Experience Engineer based out of Chennai, TN. Java is my first language but I've been high on the JS ecosystem since forever :skull: I mostly work on React but I spend countless hours learning cool stuff and adapting to the latest tech out there.
    <br />
    <br />
    While I'm not coding, you can find me raving about how beautiful :soccer: is. I'm a huge Chelsea fan and a sucker for cinema! I also play the guitar and sing.
